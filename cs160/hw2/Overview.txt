# Abstract:	Overview of HW2 Solution.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Revision: $Id$
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------


My code for HW2 is spread across 3 files:

1. cscie160/hw2/Elevator.java
2. cscie160/hw2/Floor.java
3. cscie160/hw2/ElevatorFullException.java


Since the hw2 spec requires the Elevator to work together with the Floor
objects I've added additional method members to the Elevator class; methods
like unloadPassenger() and registerRequest().  These additional methods allow
the Floors to operate the elevator as necessary.


In the previous assignment I used the destRequests[] array to keep track
of which floors the elevator needed to stop at.  This array continues to
track destination requests for the Elevator, but now the array is managed
by the methods Elevator.registerRequest() and Floor.unloadPassengers().

If the Elevator is loading passengers and the ElevatorFullExeption is
thrown, then the remaining passengers are left on the floor. The Floor
signals the Elevator to come back again on the next sweep to collect
the remaining passengers.  As with HW1, the elevator sweeps the building
continuously until you hit CTRL+C.


The solution has been compiled into a jar file; hw2.jar.
Use the following command to run the solution from the command line:

$ java -jar hw2.jar


To stop the elevator from running enter CTRL+C.
All of the source code, documentation, and javadocs for this solution are
contained in the hw2.jar file.  The jar file also contains an ant build
file that will build an hw2.jar file from source.
