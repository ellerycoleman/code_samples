My solution for HW4 is spread across 9 files:

1. cscie160/hw4/Account.java
2. cscie160/hw4/ATMException.java
3. cscie160/hw4/ATMImplementation.java
4. cscie160/hw4/ATM.java
5. cscie160/hw4/ATMProxy.java
6. cscie160/hw4/Client.java
7. cscie160/hw4/Commands.java
8. cscie160/hw4/Server.java
9. build.xml


Of these 9 files, 6 were provided by Prof. Sawyer.
I provided the Account.java, ATMImplementation.java, and build.xml files.

The Account class provides a single data member (balance) with a getter
and setter to manipulate the balance.  The ATMImplementation class creates
an Account object and then listens for client requests on the specified port.
The getBalance(), withdraw(), and deposit() methods for ATMImplementation
make use of the getter/setter for the Account class in order to accomplish
their work.

The build.xml file for HW4 is similar to the build.xml files that I've
submitted as part of previous homework assignments.  The difference is
that this version of build.xml stores the *.class files in a separate
directory from the source, and it doesn't include the source as part of
the jar file.  The default target will 'clean' the directory, compile
the java source, create the javadocs, and generate the jar file.

The resulting jar file contains both the Client and Server binaries.
To run the client:

$ java -cp hw4.jar cscie160.hw4.Client localhost 1099



To run the server:
$ java -cp hw4.jar cscie160.hw4.Server



The jar file contains the overview for this assignment, along with the javadocs,
sample output, and the ant build file.  There is no source in the jar file.
