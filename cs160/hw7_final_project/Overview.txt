My solution for HW5 is spread across 8 files:


1. cscie160/hw5/ATM.java
2. cscie160/hw5/ATMException.java
3. cscie160/hw5/ATMFactory.java
4. cscie160/hw5/ATMFactoryImpl.java
5. cscie160/hw5/ATMImpl.java
6. cscie160/hw5/Account.java
7. cscie160/hw5/Client.java
8. cscie160/hw5/Server.java


The Account class now has 3 data members:
1. balance
2. accountNumber
3. numberGenerator

The "numberGenerator" is a static integer that is used to provide a unique bank
account number whenever a new Account is created.  The Account class now provides
methods to support deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries based on the
supplied account number.

The ATMImpl class provides a static collection of bank accounts.  These accounts
are stored in a hashmap which uses the bank account number as the key.  The
constructor for this class initializes 3 accounts as required by the spec.

ATMFactoryImpl provides a static collection of atm machines.  You can request a
reference to an ATM by calling getATM() with the atm number as a parameter.
If you don't specify an ATM number then getATM() will return a reference to the
first ATM.  For this assignment I've only created a single atm, but the support
for multiple atms is present.

The build.xml file for HW5 is similar to the build.xml files that I've
submitted as part of previous homework assignments.  It builds a jar file
containg the hw5 implementation.  You can use the following commands to run
the code:


$ rmiregistry -J-cp -Jproject.jar
$ java -cp project.jar cscie160.project.BankServer
$ java -cp project.jar cscie160.project.ATMServer
$ java -cp project.jar cscie160.project.Client


The jar file contains the overview for this assignment, along with the javadocs,
sample output, and the ant build file.  There is no source in the jar file; it is
provided in a separate zip file.
